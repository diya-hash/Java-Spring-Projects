9. Difference Between == operator and equals method w.r.t String class?

- The == operator compares the data itself.
- The equals method compares the reference of the object.
- The equals method is defined in the Object class which compares the the reference value of an object. This method can be overriden in to compare the data of an object instead.

15. Does Java support multiple Inheritance?
- No, it does not support multiple inheritance. This is because methods may have the same method definition/method function and it can get confused as to which one to use. 

16. If there are three interfaces with similar abstract methods in all of them, what happens? Will I get ambiguity?
- No, because the abstract methods will get definedd in the class that is implementing the interface. And in one class, we can have only one unique definition of an abstract method. That is the point of having abstract methods in interfaces.

17. Can there be similar Hashcodes? What happends during that time in a hashmap?
- Hashcodes are generated by random manipulation on an address of the object. So, no the hashcode cannot be similar because of the random manipulation which is not absolute. 

18. Important Methods in Object class and String class?
- Hashcode
- Equals 
- Clone
- Finalize
- getClass
- wait
- wait with one param
- wait with 2 params
- notify

19. How did you implement your own Hashcode() method, what logic did you implement?
- Hashcode will be used to generate duplicate hashcodes for duplicate data. But the logic is?

20. How does set internally detect duplicate data?
-
