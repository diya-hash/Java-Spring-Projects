What is the advantage of lambda function?

- Conciseness:
  Functiional interfaces can represented by lambda functions.

- Readability:
  By eliminating boilerplate code, the code becomes for readble and short. Making the code more expressive and easier to understand.

- Flexibility:
  Can create more adaptable code with Lambda functions. It can give behaviour to methods as a pramater by utilizing functional interfaces and lamda expressions. Thus, code is more modular/versatile and can be applied to various situations.

-Parallelism:
The idea of streams, a potent tool for working with collections, was introduced in Java 8. The simplicity with which streams can be parallelized is one of its benefits. We may make use of multi-core processors and boost the efficiency of our programmes by using lambda expressions to define the behaviour of a stream operation.
