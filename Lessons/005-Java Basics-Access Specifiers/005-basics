# Ways to get return types values

- When the dataype of the method is a non-void method.
- void method doesn't require return.

# Why Constructors are required?

- They are required to create/instantiate objects.
- Types of constructors depends on the number of parameters - zero parameters, 1 or more paramter.
- Default constructor: Empty/zero paramater constructor. If a constructor is implemented then the default construcor won't be created. Default constructor created by JVM.
- Non-default constructor: can have logic manually created.
- Default constructor will have the same "Access-specifier" as the class "Access-specifier"
- Class cannot be private.

# Access-Specifier

- Package: Folders containing classes according to use-case. Example: com.sbi.card, com.sbi.loan, etc.
- When a variable is required/used just inside the class then declare it as private.
- Importing package: telling where to find a class.
- Default and Protected: Accessible within the package; Protected: accessible only within the class and outside the package is the class is a child class.
- public variable: Accessible everywhere
- Private: accessible through setters and getters

# API

- Web servoces are APIs.
- All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are web services.
