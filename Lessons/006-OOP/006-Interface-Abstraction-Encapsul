# Data Hiding

- Hiding data

# Abstract

- Hiding internal coding

# Encapsulation

- Combining variables and methods into a single unit

# Inheritance

- All properties are available to child but not constructors, provate variables/methods from the parent class
- Cannot extend more than one class. Java doesn't supprt multiple inhertiance - cause of ambiguity.
- IS-A: It is when the child class is extending the parent class to get aceess to their members.
- HAS-A: It is when we create object of another class to access the other class's members
- Object class is a default parent class to every class
- Parent object cannot be stored in a child class/object. Example: Child c = new Parent(); Can only acess Parent class's members.

# Constructor Chaining

- super(): this is by default in every zero parameter constructor of the child class
- this(): this is implemented explicitly and implicitly
- Parent class must have public/default constructor for child class to create/access parent class members/properties

# Overloading

- When we have multiple method with different parameters but same method name
- Required for increasing reliability
- required for consistency/readability
